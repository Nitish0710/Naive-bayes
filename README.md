# Naive-bayes
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple and effective algorithm used for classification tasks.
# What is it?
It's a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that predicts the class or category of a given instance based on its features. It calculates the probability of each class, given the feature values, and assigns the instance to the class with the highest probability.

## The Naive Bayes Classifier assumes that the features are conditionally independent of each other, given the class label. This assumption is called the "naive" assumption.

# When to use it?
The Naive Bayes Classifier is useful for:
Text classification (spam filtering, sentiment analysis, etc.)
Recommendation systems
Medical diagnosis
Weather prediction

## It works well with high-dimensional data and can handle missing values easily. However, it may not perform as well when the feature independence assumption is violated or when there are strong feature dependencies.
